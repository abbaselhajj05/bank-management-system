# Bank Management System â€“ C++ OOP Project  

## Overview  
This **C++ console application** demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** through a structured **bank management system**. Designed for **bank employees**, it provides **secure login** and essential functionalities, including **client management, transaction processing, user administration, and currency exchange**. Built with **custom libraries** and **file-based data persistence**, the project showcases key OOP concepts such as **encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism**.  

## Features  

### Secure Authentication  
- Role-based access control ensures restricted functionalities.  

### Client Management  
- Add, update, search, and remove client records.  

### Transactions  
- Perform **deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers** securely with real-time balance updates.  

### User Administration  
- Manage bank employees with **permission-based access**.  

### Currency Exchange  
- Track exchange rates and handle multi-currency transactions.  

### Data Persistence  
- **File-based storage** retains data across sessions.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Language:** C++  
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio  
- **Programming Concepts:** Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism  
- **File Handling:** Text-based storage for persistence  

## Getting Started
